This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in PHP: premature loop termination due to misplaced return statements within conditional blocks.  The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code. The solution in `bugSolution.php` rectifies the issue by restructuring the code to avoid unintended exits and ensure the loop completes as intended.  This is a crucial aspect of defensive programming, emphasizing careful code structuring and proper handling of control flow.
